            <p>Zeus is the king of the Greek gods and ruler of the sky, thunder, and justice. Often depicted with a thunderbolt, he presides over Mount Olympus and maintains order among gods and humans. According to Greek mythology, Zeus overthrew his father, Cronus, to claim his throne and became known for his power, wisdom, and many mythic adventures.</p>

             <p>Poseidon is the Greek god of the sea, earthquakes, and horses. Recognizable by his trident, he rules over all waters and is known for his powerful, unpredictable temper. As one of the three major Olympian brothers — alongside Zeus and Hades — Poseidon plays a central role in Greek myth, shaping coastlines, stirring storms, and influencing the fate of sailors.</p>

            <img src="pictures/thor.jpeg" alt="thor picture,the god of thunder" width="195", height="230">
            <p>Thor is one of the most famous gods in Norse mythology, known as the god of thunder, storms, and protection. Wielding his enchanted hammer, Mjölnir, he defends both gods and humans from giants and other threats. Thor is celebrated for his immense strength, straightforward nature, and role as a heroic guardian of the cosmos.</p>

            <img src="pictures/aries.jpeg" alt="Aries picture, the God of war" width="195", height="230">
             <p>Ares (sometimes spelled Aries, though “Ares” is the correct Greek god) is the Greek god of war, representing the brutal, chaotic, and violent aspects of battle. Unlike Athena, who symbolizes strategic warfare, Ares embodies raw conflict and aggression. He is often portrayed as fierce and impulsive, feared even by other gods for the destruction he brings.</p>
